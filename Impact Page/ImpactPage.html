            <li><strong>300 pets adopted into loving homes:</strong> With your help, we’ve organized weekly adoption events and created awareness campaigns to connect pets with forever families.</li>
            <li><strong>New mobile clinic launched:</strong> Your funds helped us purchase and equip a mobile veterinary clinic, bringing healthcare directly to underserved areas and rescue zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Pet food drives for struggling families:</strong> Through donation-matching and local partnerships, we’ve distributed over 10,000 lbs of food to help pet owners in financial distress keep their animals.</li>
            <li><strong>Animal rescue during natural disasters:</strong> We were able to deploy rapid-response teams during recent floods and storms, rescuing and relocating animals to safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational outreach programs:</strong> We visited over 20 schools this year to teach children about animal kindness, responsible pet ownership, and volunteering opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Training for shelter volunteers:</strong> Contributions funded workshops to better prepare our volunteers in animal care, behavior training, and adoption counseling.</li>
