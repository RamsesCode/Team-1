    <h1>Welcome to Donating Animal Shelters</h1>
    <img src="/Users/tranv/Team-1/Team-1/cat1.jpg" alt="Cute Cat" >
    <p>Your support helps us provide care and shelter for animals in need.</p>
    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>Join us in making a difference. Whether you want to volunteer, donate, or adopt, your contribution is invaluable.</p>
    <p>Every year, over **6.5 million** shelter animals need loving homes, but sadly, nearly **1.5 million** are euthanized due to lack of resources. Your donation can provide food, medical care, and safe shelter to help reduce this number and save lives. Just a small contribution can make a huge differenceâ€”**\$25** can feed a shelter pet for a month and bring them one step closer to a forever home.
