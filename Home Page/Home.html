        Every year, over <strong>6.5 million</strong> shelter animals need loving homes, but sadly, nearly <strong>1.5 million</strong> are euthanized due to lack of resources. Your donation can provide food, medical care, and safe shelter to help reduce this number and save lives. Just a small contribution can make a huge differenceâ€”<strong>$25</strong> can feed a shelter pet for a month and bring them one step closer to a forever home.
