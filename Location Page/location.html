    <h3>Animal Care Centers of NYC</h3>
    <p> 
        Animal Care Centers of NYC (ACC) is dedicated to ending animal homelessness in New York City. 
        We also provide compassionate refuge for animals in need. Founded in 1995, ACC serves homeless, 
        lost, and neglected animals across all five boroughs—Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and 
        Staten Island. As the city’s only open-admissions shelter, we welcome every animal, no matter their 
        background or condition. Each year, we care for over 15,000 animals.
